Lately, people have been asking me when they'll be able to sign up for internet service from Orchard Broadband. I'm glad to hear there's interest in what Orchard Broadband has to offer, but the answer to that question may be disappointing. It's going to be a while longer.

It's very important that Orchard Broadband be able to offer quality service to the customers it serves. In order to make sure connections are strong and stable, a lot testing needs to be done.

It's highly likely that the Orchard Broadband network will have to undergo several configuration changes in its early days. Configuration changes mean unpredictable down time - and no one likes down time.
